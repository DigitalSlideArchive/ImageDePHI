## Installation
* Download the [latest ImageDePHI release](https://github.com/DigitalSlideArchive/ImageDePHI/releases/latest).

* Unzip the downloaded file, which will extract the executable named `imagedephi` (or `imagedephi.exe` on Windows).

## Usage
From a command line, execute the application to get full usage help.

Alternatively **on Windows only**, directly open `imagdephi.exe` in Windows Explorer to launch the ImageDePHI GUI.

If running on macOS, you may need to [add the executable to the list of trusted software](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/apple-cant-check-app-for-malicious-software-mchleab3a043/mac) to launch ImageDePHI in the same way you would any other registered app.
